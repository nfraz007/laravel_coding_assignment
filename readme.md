Writing backend API for the To Do List application.

* Users Should be able to mark a Task Complete
* Users Should be able to delete a Task ( Soft Delete )
* Users should be able to filter Tasks based on `due-date` should be possible using the following - Today, This Week, Next Week, Overdue.
* Search (on `title`) should be available.
* All tasks which are soft deleted for more than a month should be permanently deleted from the system.

### Task Properties
* A Task will have a `title` and `due-date`.
* There are only 2 states applicable for a task. Pending or Completed.
* Tasks can have related sub-tasks.
